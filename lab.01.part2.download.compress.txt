==========
Downloading files from a web site:  We'll use the following method to download more lab materials!

What if I want to save a file from a website?
What flag/option and option argument would I use to download a web page to a file called mygoogle.html?

8. Run the following command *exactly* as it appears:

$ curl -o mygoogle.html www.google.com

Now copy and paste the output below.
----------


  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

Write the command you used to determine your directory. Also, copy and paste the output below.

$ pwd
/c/Users/Alexito




==========
10. If you're not in your home directory, change to it (use the shortcut).

Write the command that you used to change to your home directory.
If you were already in your home directory, write the command that you *would* have used to change to it!
----------

cd ../

==========
11. So... the lab materials are located at this url:

http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-Fall2020/labs/01/my-flashcards.zip

Download the file using curl... to a file called MTEC1003-my-flashcards.zip.
DON'T copy/paste the download link! Use the command line to download the file.

REMEMBER to use the -o flag, and follow it with a .zip extension!
Then, use ls to verify that it downloaded.

Write down the command(s) that you used to download the file below.
Finally, write the output of the command below.
----------


$ curl -o file.zip http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL78/labs/01/my-flashcards.zip
